# `docker.io/paketobuildpacks/dynatrace`
The Paketo Buildpack for Dynatrace is a Cloud Native Buildpack that contributes the Dynatrace OneAgent and configures it to connect to the service.

## Behavior
This buildpack will participate if either of the following conditions is met:

* A binding exists with `name` containing `Dynatrace`
* A binding exists with `type` of `Dynatrace`

**Note**:
While a single binding may match both conditions, you may *not* have multiple bindings that match the conditions above. Multiple Dynatrace service bindings are not supported for a single application.

**Note**:
The binding must include the following required Secret values to successfully contribute Dynatrace


| Key                                           | Value Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `api-url`<br/>  **or** <br/> `environment-id` | The base URL of the Dynatrace API. If not set, `environment-id` must be set. <br/> --- <br/> If `api-url` is not set, a URL is configured in the form: https://<`environment-id`>.live.dynatrace.com/api |
| `api-token`                                   | (Required) The token for communicating with the Dynatrace service.                                                                                                                                       |

**Note**:
the API URL and API token secret keys support multiple casing options for ease of integration.
This buildpack will choose to use `api-url` over `apiurl` and `api-token` over `apitoken` if both are set.

The buildpack will do the following for .NET, Go, Apache HTTPD, Java, Nginx, NodeJS, PHP and Python applications:

* Contributes a OneAgent including the appropriate libraries to a layer and configures `$LD_PRELOAD` to use it
* Sets `$DT_TENANT`, `$DT_TENANTTOKEN`, and `$DT_CONNECTION_POINT` at launch time.
* Transforms the contents of the binding secret to environment variables with the pattern `DT_<KEY>=<VALUE>`
  * Excluding `api-token`, `apitoken`, `api-url`, `apiurl`, and `environment-id`

## Bindings
The buildpack optionally accepts the following bindings:

### Type: `dependency-mapping`
| Key                   | Value   | Description                                                                                       |
|-----------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<dependency-digest>` | `<uri>` | If needed, the buildpack will fetch the dependency with digest `<dependency-digest>` from `<uri>` |
